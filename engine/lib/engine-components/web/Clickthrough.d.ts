/**
 * ClickThrough component allows pointer events to "click through" the 3D canvas to HTML elements behind it.
 *
 * This is useful if you have a transparent canvas overlaying HTML content and want to interact with the HTML content through the transparent areas of the canvas.
 *
 * Usage Options:
 * - Add the ClickThrough component to any GameObject in your scene.
 * - Alternatively, add the `clickthrough` attribute to the `<needle-engine>` HTML element (e.g. `<needle-engine clickthrough></needle-engine>`).
 *
 * - Example https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/needle-engine/sample-3d-over-html
