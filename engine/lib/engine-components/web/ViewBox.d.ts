 * This component can be used to automatically fit a certain box area into the camera view - no matter your screen size or aspect ratio.
 * This is useful for example to frame a character or object in the center of the screen and ensure it is always fully visible. You can also animate or scale the viewbox to create zoom or framing effects.
 *
 * - [Example on needle.run](https://viewbox-demo-z23hmxbz2gkayo-z1nyzm6.needle.run/)

 * - [Example on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/needle-engine-view-box-example)
 *
 * @example Add a Viewbox component to an object in your scene
 * ```ts
  const viewBox = new Object3D();
  viewBox.scale.set(0, 0, 0);
  viewBox.addComponent(ViewBox, { debug: true });
  scene.add(viewBox);
